# String_Function
First code: a program that reads a string from the input and prints its length on the output without strlen function.

Second code: a program that reads two strings in the form of a pointer and then tells if the second string exists in the first one or not.

Third code: a program that reads a string from the input using the pointer form, then removes the entered blanks and digits, and finally prints the resulting string in the output.
